# Irrigation-Scheduling-Recommendations-And-Dataset

The goal of this project is to create a dataset of irrigation scheduling methods and their performances at different farm locations with different plants by scraping a large number of research papers.

In this folder are two directories for dataset creation and processing. 

In the data_creation folder, all_papers.csv is a CSV file containing DOI URLs of all scraped papers. The individual PDFs are stored privately.
