# Irrigation-Scheduling-Recommendations-And-Dataset

The goal of this project is to create an irrigation scheduling method recommendation system using AI/ML.
In order to do so, a dataset of irrigation scheduling methods and their performances at different farm locations with different plants is necessary. 

The first two directories are for dataset creation, where research papers are scraped for relevant features, and dataset processing, where these features are categorized and standardized.
In the data_creation folder, all_papers.csv is a CSV file containing DOI URLs of all scraped papers. The individual PDFs are stored privately.
